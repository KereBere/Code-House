  This is the source code of my blog I have created with Vue & Vuex. It is powered by Firebase Authentication, Firebase Storage and Firebase Functions. Feel free to download and create your own blog. You only need to do Firebase configuration. It might not be the best blog ever but I genuinely like it because I have spents many hours to make it.
